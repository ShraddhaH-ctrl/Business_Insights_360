## Companyâ€™s back ground
The company AltiQ Hardware has experienced significant growth in recent years and has expanded its operations worldwide. This business offers computers and computer accessories for sale through three different channels.

- Stores
- Direct
- Sellers

Based on surveys, gut feeling, and some Excel research, the company recently suffered an unanticipated loss when it opened a store in America. Additionally, the company's competitors have a small number of analytics teams that can conduct analysis and make data-driven decisions. To improve its chances of surviving in the market, AltiQ Hardware will therefore have to expand its analytics staff in order to make data-driven decisions and insights in the future. 

Project Goal: The main objective of this project is to make the goals and purpose of the data analytics programme more clear. The final report will answer many concerns regarding the performance of the organisation and act as a cornerstone for data-driven decision-making. It represents an essential step towards succeeding in the market as well as just surviving it.
